Each day, each person goes to a locus. If there are any **I**nfected people in a locus, each **S**usceptible person at that locus has a probability `prob_infect` of becoming **I**nfected. At the end of the day, each person who was **I**nfected at the start of the day **R**ecovers with probability `prob_recover`.
